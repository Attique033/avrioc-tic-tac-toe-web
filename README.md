## Key Dependencies

- `@reduxjs/toolkit`: State management
- `react-router-dom`: Client-side routing
- `axios`: HTTP client for API requests
- `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework
- `typescript`: Type safety and better developer experience

## Development Features

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API communication

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
yarn test

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format
```

## Security Considerations

- JWT tokens are stored securely in cookies
- API requests are authenticated
- Input validations
- API error handling
- Protected routes

## Performance Optimizations

- Code splitting with React Router
- Optimized bundle size with Vite
- Efficient state management with Redux Toolkit
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
